    <p class="photo-caption">These are the most wonderful biscuits you'll ever
        put in your mouth. They are the biggest, best
        tasting, lightest, and fluffiest biscuits I've ever
        had. They're not very hard to make either.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1⁄8 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3⁄4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1⁄2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shortening</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 1⁄4 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1⁄2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Spray a 10 1/2 inch
        cast iron skillet with non stick cooking spray.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt and sugar. Cut in
        the shortening and softened butter with a fork until the lumps are
        pea size. Gently stir in the buttermilk until all of the flour is
        incorporated; do not over mix. The dough should be very wet. If not,
        add more buttermilk to achieve a sloppy consistency. Let stand for 2
        to 3 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Place all-purpose flour in a bowl. Spray an ice cream scoop or large
        spoon with vegetable spray and scoop out dough. Drop each biscuit
        one at a time into the flour. Using well-floured hands, pick up each
        piece and pass from hand to hand lightly to shake off excess flour
        and shape it into a soft round. Place the biscuits gently into cast iron
        skillet. They will be a tight fit. Do not mash the biscuits down! Brush
        tops lightly with melted butter.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Bake at 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) for 16 to 18 minutes. Cool
        before serving.</p>
