    <p>Triple Cheddar and Colby Jack bring lots of cheese flavor
        to this creamy mac & cheese with just a hint of heat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Borden Triple Cheddar Natural Shreds</li>
        <li>1 cup Borden Colby Jack Natural Shreds</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Borden Butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Borden Vitamin D Milk</li>
        <li>1 cup Borden Half & Half</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the inside of a 1 1/2-quart
        casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray. Combine Cheddar and
        Colby Jack cheeses in a medium bowl and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Cook macaroni in boiling salted water according to package
        directions; drain well and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Blend
        in flour, stirring constantly, until smooth and bubbly. Gradually whisk
        in milk and half & half. Stir constantly, until mixture boils and
        thickens (about 2 to 3 minutes). Remove from heat and add cayenne
        and black peppers, and 2 cups of the reserved cheese mixture; stir
        until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Stir cooked macaroni into the sauce and season to taste. Place in the
        prepared casserole dish. Top with remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and
        dot with additional butter, if desired. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until
        heated through and lightly browned.</p>
